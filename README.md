# MyUnityDemo
This is a Unity architectural walkthrough project I developed to test and demonstrate the latest rendering features of Unity 5.
Note that the project needs to go through baking again because the lightmap is >100MB and thus cannot be synced to github.
A short video of the project is here: https://youtu.be/d9ShSId8-WY
